Opensource and Professional Mail Verification Solution.

The idea of Mailbuff has been came from our own needs. Every company like [Appbuff](https://appbuff.net) use Email marketing services to get more business needs. We collect mail address in various ways or resources. Bad things, we normally cant check which mail ID is valid and which is not valid. In this case, we get lot of Bounch issues.

We used to use many Free and even premium services to verify Mail ID, such as [VerifyEmailAddress.org](https://www.verifyemailaddress.org/). But problem was, we cant verify in bulk or we cant download all verified mail in bulk or not even in CSV format.

We even purchase many readymade Email verification script, but none of the fullfill our purpose. We needed something very simple but with some advance features.

After spending some time, we come with this [Mailbuff](https://github.com/appbuff/mailbuff) solution. :fire: Mailbuff is being used by [Appbuff](https://appbuff.net) Digital Marketing Team adn they are totally satisfied.
